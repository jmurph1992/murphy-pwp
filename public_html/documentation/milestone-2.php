		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

		<div>

			<h3>Home Page</h3>

			<p>This will be a one page site that contains the following sections: </p>

			<p><strong>Welcome: </strong> This section of the site is at the top and is the first thing the visitor will see.
				It will contain the name of the clan in large cursive letters as well as the clan motto. For the background, I
				will place a photo or some sort of graphic that is related to the clan, nothing too attention grabbing.</p><br>

			<p><strong>About us: </strong> This section will give an introduction to the clan. This will contain our mission
				statement, our goal as a clan, and our general structure as a clan. This section will also include a list (or gallery)
				of all the games we play as a clan. This list will not cover every game every member plays, but rather a collection of games
				that we like to play as a group.</p> <br>

			<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong> This part of the site will have an image gallery of the core members of the clan.
				It will have some animation, I would like to make the mem ber pictures clickable and have them flip over and
				have limited member info on the other side. </p> <br>

			<p><strong>Contact: </strong> This section will contain a simple contact form that sends emails/membership requests
				to a selected email address. At the footer will be a link to the clan page for further information and resources.</p>
