This is a project that is a display page for the 
gaming clan that I am a member of.

## Milestone 1 feedback

* Your commits are a bit bigger than they should be, and several of them have the same commit message.  Make sure you're doing more frequent, smaller commits with unique messages so that if you need to undo them or reference them later, you can easily find them.
* You hit all the requirements for your user persona, but I would suggest fleshing it out a little bit more to give developers and other stakeholders a bit more of a full understanding of who Gerald really is.  
* Your file structure is perfect.
* Your HTML is well formatted, clean, and validates perfectly using the validator.  Nice work.

Overall, this is a bit sparse, but very good work.  Your technical work is excellent, and the only technical area to improve is your git hygiene.  As you move forward with the project, make sure that you are giving enough context to your end user.  Although you hit the basics of a persona, if you take the same approach with the content of your site, you run the risk of your website coming across as terse and/or bland.  Make sure you are a bit more verbose and consider what extra flourishes would attract a gamer audience.

With early submission, this grades at a Tier IV.

## Milestone 2a Feedback

Nice work here. Your wireframes and accompanying strategy are clear and defined. This will provide you a good guide moving into your development phase.

Be careful with the staggered layout when it comes to your Portfolio section on mobile. You might want to stack these items on the smallest screens to ensure there is enough space to comfortably read the text - the horizontal space might get too narrow, so stagger only on screen sizes that can accommodate it well.

Here are a few recommedations:
Google Fonts for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
FontAwesome is a good quality free library for including iconography.
FancyBox for an interactive gallery.

Also, you might want to consider having your navbar on full display on the desktop view and use the hamburger menu only on mobile view.

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
